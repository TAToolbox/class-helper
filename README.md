# Class Helper

## Instructions:

1. Create a `~/bin` folder if you don't already have one
2. Copy this script to that folder
3. Change rights to the file by typing `cd bin && chmod u+x class-helper`

   - This is for all bash scripts, it won't run otherwise. You are welcome to try though.

### **Change the directory paths for your use case**

I would keep the class repo path set to `~/Documents/Test` for now so you don't run into any issues with the class repo during testing
