# Class Helper

## Instructions:

1. Create a `~/bin` folder if you don't already have one
2. Copy this script to that folder 

   - Only necessary if you want to run the script from anywhere in bash
   
3. Change rights to the file with `chmod u+x ~/bin/class-helper`

   - This gives the user (u) the right to execute (x) the script

### **Change the directory paths for your use case**

I advise most people to keep the class repo path set to `~/Documents/Test` during testing until you are comfortable making changes to the _real_ class repo.
